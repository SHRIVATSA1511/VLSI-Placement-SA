# VLSI-Placement-SA
Simulated Annealing for Chip Floor-planning: An implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm to solve the classic chip floor-planning problem. The project focuses on minimizing wirelength and avoiding module overlap to find an optimal placement of electronic components on a chip.
